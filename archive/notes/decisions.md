# Decisions & Learning Log

**Purpose:** Track important decisions, patterns observed, and principles learned.

**How to use:**
- Record decisions with clear rationale
- Capture behavioral patterns you observe (user, project, yourself)
- Extract reusable principles from repeated experiences
- Link to related episodes: `logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md:line` or `[episode description](logs/filename.md)`
- When same pattern appears 3+ times, mark for consolidation into a principle
- Principles guide future decisions - reference them when relevant

## 2025-10-15 - Starting Strategy

**Decision:** Start with cellar, 3 boxes at a time
**Rationale:**
- Cellar is high priority
- Small batch size prevents overwhelm
- Matches historical pattern of "taking everything out" that led to stalls
- 3 boxes is manageable for 90-minute session
