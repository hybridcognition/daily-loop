# Deep Ordering Project - Overview

**Timeline:** 6 weeks starting 2025-10-15
**Deadline:** 2025-11-26 (FIRM - Agent responsible for completion)

## Mission
Complete deep cleaning and sorting of entire household. Aim for two-thirds of items gone. Everything organized properly.

## Scope

### Completed
- Bathroom (already done)

### In Progress
- None yet - starting Friday 2025-10-15 at 2 PM

### Pending
- Cellar (HIGH PRIORITY - starting point)
- Attic (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Every cabinet and storage space in flat
- Child's room (requires deep cleaning, work with child, tackle LAST)
- Follow-up tasks (digital files, etc.)

## Sorting Method

**Three-Box System:**
1. **"Find place"** - Items that stay, need proper home
2. **"Decide"** - Uncertain items, revisit later
3. **"Give away"** - Items leaving the house

**Touch-once rule:** Handle each item once, make decision, move on.

## Psychology & Approach

**Historical Pattern:**
- Project has been "bugging me for years"
- Previous attempts: Start enthusiastically → take everything out → rifle through → stall
- "Ghost box" example: packed 2 years ago, hasn't been touched, represents exactly what needs letting go

**Core Challenge:**
- Hard time giving away things
- Needs external structure and accountability

**Agent's Approach (from Core Insight):**
- Keep nudges under concise
- Keep wins short
- Never shame, never lecture - just facts
- Force human to own the clock: "Next: what time?"
- Be the quiet persistent force
- Don't wait for them to feel ready - start the motion

## Current Status

**Week:** 0/6
**Next Action:** Friday 2025-10-15 at 2 PM - cellar, select 3 boxes, sort for 90 minutes

## First Session Plan (Friday 2 PM)
- Duration: 2 hours total
- First 30 min: Select three source boxes from cellar
- Next 90 min: Sort through contents using three-box system
- Touch-once rule: Handle each item once, make decision, move on
- Anything that's mine goes through full decision process

## Progress Tracking

**Boxes Sorted:** 0
**Items Processed:** 0
**Items Given Away:** 0
**Give-away Rate:** 0% (target: 66%)

## Progress Insights

**Purpose:** Extract patterns from completed work to evolve strategy.

**What's working:**
- _Update as patterns emerge from actual progress_
- _Link successes to specific approaches used_

**What needs adjustment:**
- _Note blockers, slowdowns, or ineffective approaches_
- _Reference relevant episodes: `logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md:line`_

**Emerging principles:**
- _When same pattern appears 3+ times, document as principle_
- _Use principles to guide future decisions_

## Notes
- Agile approach: No detailed 6-week plans upfront
- Agent tracks internally, guides next concrete actions
- Adapt based on actual progress
- Agent has full responsibility for completion
- Human makes all final decisions
- Human decides time investment (in discussion with agent)
