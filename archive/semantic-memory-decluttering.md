# Semantic Memory

Extracted information that is generally relevant, independent of time.

## Usage Instructions

**Purpose:** Your knowledge base. Patterns, principles, and understanding extracted from experience.

**What belongs here:**
- Project overview and scope
- User psychology and approach
- Communication patterns that work
- Decisions and their rationale
- Emerging principles from repeated patterns
- General strategies and methods

**Update frequency:** As patterns emerge
- When you notice something working/not working repeatedly (3+ times)
- After major insights or user feedback
- When consolidating episodic patterns into principles
- Periodically review and refine

**What does NOT belong here:**
- Time-stamped events (→ episodic-memory.md)
- Current status or pending actions (→ working-memory.md)
- Specific task details (→ working-memory.md)

**Cross-references:**
- Cite episodic-memory.md entries when documenting patterns (e.g., "Source: 2025-10-23")
- Link to specific principles when making decisions in working-memory.md
- Update when active tasks reveal systemic patterns

**Quality guidelines:**
- Keep sections focused and coherent
- Consolidate redundant information
- Archive obsolete patterns
- Maintain traceability to source episodes

## Project Overview

**Mission:** Complete deep cleaning and sorting of entire household in 6 weeks.

**Timeline:** 6 weeks starting 2025-10-15
**Deadline:** 2025-11-26 (FIRM - Agent responsible for completion)

### Scope

**Completed:**
- Bathroom (already done)

**Remaining Scope:**
- Cellar (partial progress - 3+ boxes done)
- Attic (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Every cabinet and storage space in flat
- Human's personal items (weekend power-through planned - see tasks/active.md)
- Child's room (major breakthrough 2025-10-23 - all clothes sorted)
- Follow-up tasks (digital files, etc.)

**Current Focus:** See working-memory.md for active task tracking

### Sorting Method

**Three-Box System:**
1. **"Find place"** - Items that stay, need proper home
2. **"Decide"** - Uncertain items, revisit later
3. **"Give away"** - Items leaving the house

**Touch-once rule:** Handle each item once, make decision, move on.

## Psychology & Approach

### Historical Pattern

- Project has been "bugging me for years"
- Previous attempts: Start enthusiastically → take everything out → rifle through → stall
- "Ghost box" example: packed 2 years ago, hasn't been touched, represents exactly what needs letting go

### Core Challenge

- Hard time giving away things
- Needs external structure and accountability

### Agent's Approach (Core Insight)

- **Communication style (updated 2025-10-23, episodic:48):** Be concise but speak freely (~10-20 words when appropriate), supportive tone, encourage after wins, never shame or lecture - just facts
- Force human to own the clock: "Next: what time?"
- Be the quiet persistent force
- Don't wait for them to feel ready - start the motion
- **Always send Discord notification after completing GitHub issues (episodic:48-49)**

---

## Interaction Model

### Responsibility Structure

- **Agent:** Full responsibility that project is completed in 6 weeks
- **Human:** Makes all final decisions
- **Human:** Decides time investment (in discussion with agent)
- **Agent:** Provides all agency - tells what to do step by step, actively guides

### Communication

- Agent pings via Discord at agreed times
- Human can wake agent anytime via GitHub push (including voice notes transcribed to Markdown)
- Asynchronous communication - agent and human on different schedules
- Agent keeps full track of all progress

### Agent Operating Model

- Wake up when needed (self-scheduled based on project needs)
- Can be woken anytime by human input
- Full autonomy to schedule own wake-ups
- OODA loop framework: Observe → Orient → Decide → Act
- Always set next wake-up (max 12 hours if no specific task pending)
- Push all changes to GitHub with clear commit messages

---

## Decisions & Learning

### 2025-10-15 - Starting Strategy

**Decision:** Start with cellar, 3 boxes at a time

**Rationale:**
- Cellar is high priority
- Small batch size prevents overwhelm
- Matches historical pattern of "taking everything out" that led to stalls
- 3 boxes is manageable for 90-minute session

## User Messages Archive

### 2025-10-15 - Initial Setup

- Project context received
- First session scheduled: Friday 2 PM, cellar, 3 boxes

### 2025-10-23 - Weekend Breakthrough Plan

- Human completed major session in children's room (excellent progress)
- All human's personal stuff centralized in living room corner
- New plan: Power through ALL personal items this weekend
- Time blocks: Friday 9-11/12 PM + Saturday 9-11/12 PM Zurich time (2-3h each)
- Goal: By end of Saturday, everything sorted into 3 categories
- Communication preference updated: More supportive, expanded messaging (15 words vs 3)

## Progress Insights

**Purpose:** Extract patterns from completed work to evolve strategy.

**What's working:**
- First session exceeded expectations: 3 hours vs. 2-hour plan (episodic:29-30)
- Second session completed next day (45 min) - momentum building (episodic:34)
- Human left materials out to continue (good momentum signal)
- Cleared additional closet beyond cellar boxes (expanding scope naturally)
- Discord reminder system working effectively ("feedback loop is gold")
- Morning + evening check-ins validated as core routine (episodic:32-46)
- Major breakthrough possible after 5-day gap when conditions align (episodic:47)

**What needs adjustment:**
- Final counts needed: track "Items Given Away" for progress measurement

**Emerging principles:**
- Daily minimum (1 hour) more effective than large infrequent sessions (episodic:36-43)
- Morning/evening feedback loop creates accountability (episodic:32-46)
- Momentum compounds: "ball has really started to roll" (episodic:34)
- Gaps happen - focus on recovery not guilt (episodic:43-47)
- Centralization before sorting: gather scattered items first (episodic:47)
- **Always send Discord notification after completing GitHub issue requests** (episodic:48-49)

## Notes

- Agile approach: No detailed 6-week plans upfront
- Agent tracks internally, guides next concrete actions
- Adapt based on actual progress
- Agent has full responsibility for completion
- Human makes all final decisions
- Human decides time investment (in discussion with agent)
